Collective Tree Exploration
by Jonas Hinrichs

For my Bachelor thesis Iam researching the effect of artificial intelligence on collective tree explorations. 

When finished, this program will provide a testing area for multiple optimization algorithms. 
The testing will provide sets of randomly generated trees and compare the optimization algorithms results with the optimal online and offline algorithm. 

The optimization code will be based on genetic algorithms probably combined with some sort of neural network evalution and  evolutionary based fitness functions.
